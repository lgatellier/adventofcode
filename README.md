# Advent of Code CLI
This project is a CLI which solves [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) exercises using the solutions I implemented.

It is also a way to practise some Python, [Typer Framework](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

Advent Of Code is a *game*, so please **don't use this project without looking for your own solution** for each exercise :wink: .

## Implemented exercises
This CLI handles the following exercises :
- Year 2023
   - Day 1 (Part 1 & 2) : Solved, but not integrated in the CLI yet
   - Day 2 (Part 1 & 2) : Solved, but not integrated in the CLI yet
   - Day 3 (Part 1 & 2)

## Usage
This project is **not published** to Pypi.org.

To run the CLI :
1. Install some recent python version
1. Clone the repository on your computer
1. Install poetry : `pip3 install poetry`
1. Install the CLI from source code : `poetry install`
1. Type `aoc --help`, and enjoy !
