# Advent of Code CLI
This project is a CLI which solves [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) exercises using the solutions I implemented.

It is also a way to practise some Python, [Typer Framework](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

Advent Of Code is a *game*, so please **don't use this project without looking for your own solution** for each exercise :wink: .

## Implemented exercises
This CLI handles the following exercises :
- Year 2022
   - Day 1
   - Day 2
   - Day 3
- Year 2023
   - Day 1
   - Day 2
   - Day 3
